        <h1>soccer</h1>
        <p>Soccer, known as football in most countries outside the United States and Canada, is a globally popular sport played between two teams. Each team has 11 players, including a goalkeeper. The game is played on a rectangular field with a goal at each end.

            The objective of soccer is to score goals by kicking or heading the ball into the opposing team's goal. Players primarily use their feet to move the ball, but they can also use their head or torso. Only goalkeepers are allowed to use their hands, and only within their designated penalty area.</p>
